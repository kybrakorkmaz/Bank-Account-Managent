                Internet Banking is a digital platform that enables you to make financial or non-financial
                transactions online. This service provides online access to almost every banking service
                traditionally available through branches, including fund transfers, deposit booking,
                and other services. Internet banking can be used by any individual who has registered
                for online banking at the bank and has an active bank account. After registering
                for online banking, you will not need to visit the bank every time you need a banking service
